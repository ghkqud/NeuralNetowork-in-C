 Brief Description : 
	A module to implement the stochastic gradient descent learning
       	algorithm for a feedforward neural network by using 5 X 5 small data. 
       	Gradients are calculated using backpropagation module that is saved in network.c file.
       	5 X 5 small data can get from get_data.c file
