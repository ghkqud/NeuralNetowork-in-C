This repository's purpose is not to operate the neural network, but to understand the code of the neural network.

network.c is main code that store feedforwad code and backward code.

if you want to operate the neural network, you must make small data.

Brief Description : 
	A module to implement the stochastic gradient descent learning
       	algorithm for a feedforward neural network by using 5 X 5 small data. 
       	Gradients are calculated using backpropagation module that is saved in network.c file.
